Prompt: 

Please describe and provide an example of how to read key-value pair input
from a file and flatten the data so the data can be ingested.

Answer:

No matter what language you are using, the steps are basically the same.

1. You need a process that can identify the integrity of the data.  This means that you need to verify that the 
file type is correct and that the data is formatted in a way that they program can parse.

2. You need to develop a function that can parse the data.  The first step is usually to split the data into manageable chunks.
After this, it needs to be seperated into the basic, flattened structure that you are looking to output.

3. Finally, you will need to restructure the data in the 2d form that you are needing for ingestion.

Note:  All of this depends on the file format (eg. JSON, YAML, CSV) and the input structure (eg. types of characters, 
delimiters, and nested data structures) and the output that you are hoping to arrange it into.  The above is a basic overview
 of the steps that would normally be taken.
